;;;; Clojure and the Google App Engine Datastore are a perfect fit. With the low-level API
;;;; you can almost directly store Clojure datastructures natively into the datastore.
;;;; To use the low-level API, we put some simple abstractions on top of it. This way the
;;;; access to the datastore feels more lispy.

;;;; These definitions are needed to understand the code:

;;;; * Entity: An Entity is a record or a struct of data that is stored in the GAE datastore.

;;;; * Variable and Parameter naming:
;;;;   When we use "entity", we always mean objects of the GAE class Entity
;;;;   When we use "entity-map" we always mean a Clojure map which can be converted
;;;;   to an "entity", because it was defined with defentity and is maintained by the
;;;;   functions and macros of this package.


;;;; * Translate: In Clojure you can use normal structs. Before you can store a struct into the
;;;;   GAE datastore, it has to be translated, because the datastore can only handle
;;;;   a fixed set of datastructures. If you want to store an instance of a type which is not supported
;;;;   by the datastore, you have to translate it to a supported datatype. Example: If
;;;;   you want to store java.util.Date (which is a supported type, but just to give you an easy example),
;;;;   you might want to translate it into Millis (long) before saving it (pre-save).
;;;;   When you retrieve it from the datastore (post-load), you have to translate it back from Millis to
;;;;   java.util.Date. So in this file, the word "translation" has nothing to do with I18N etc.

;;;; We made it really easy to define such translations. You just use the Macro defentity.
;;;; It takes a list of clauses. Each clause contains an attribute-name and (optional) options.

;;;; Valid options are:
;;;; Name         Value         Description
;;;; :pre-save    a function    Called for this attribute before an entity is saved to the datastore
;;;;                            Default is the identity function
;;;; :post-load   a function    Called for this attribute after an entity is loaded from the datastore
;;;;                            Default is the identity function
;;;; :unindexed   boolean       If true, this attribute is not indexed. If false, it will be indexed.
;;;;                            Default is false. This means the attribute will be indexed if the GAE type
;;;;                            supports indexing.

;;;; Under the hood we generate two multimethods (translate-to-datastore, translate-from-datastore) for
;;;; each defentity definition, which specialize on the kind of an entity/entity-map. These multimethods
;;;; are used to by this system to call your pre-save and post-load functions.
;;;; Check out the macro defentity for how they are generated.

;;;; You should not use these multimethods in you programs, but you can use them for debugging purposes:

(comment
  (translate-from-datastore <your-entity-goes-here>) ; DON'T RELY ON THIS IN YOU CODE. IT MIGHT CHANGE!
  (translate-to-datastore <your-entity-goes-here>)) ; SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY THIS PACKAGE!


;;;; An entity is processed in the following steps:
;;;;
;;;; Loading from the datastore:
;;;; datastore -> load -> translate-attributes -> translate entity (post-load) -> entity
;;;;
;;;; Storing in the datastore:
;;;; entity -> translate-entity (pre-save) -> translate attributes -> store -> datastore

;;;; We supplied some standard translations for the currently supported GAE datatypes, too.


;;;; Using defentity
;;;; ---------------

;;;; To define the schema of an entity, you use defentity.

(comment
  "This defines an Entity named project, with two properties, :key and :title"
  (defentity project
    [:key]
    [:title :pre-save to-text :post-load from-text]
    :options []))

;;;; CAUTION: Currently we don't evaluate the options-statement (see last line in the above example)

;;;; This creates the code to generate and convert objects of the GAE class Entity. This example
;;;; generates a function "make-project", which can be used to create entity-maps of the kind "project".

;;;; The following code creates an in-memory entity-map of the kind "project" with the attribute :title set
;;;; to "Project1".
;;;; Your entity-map is not saved to the datastore.

(comment
  (make-project :title "Project1"))

;;;; If you want to convert this to an entity object you can call to-entity. This is a
;;;; multimethod that is generated by defentity and which "knows" how to generate
;;;; a GAE Entity of this kind. But you should never use it in your code.
;;;; You can use it for debugging.

(comment
  (to-entity (make-project :title "Project1"))) ;DON'T RELY ON to-entity IN YOUR CODE. IT MIGHT CHANGE!

;;;; You NEVER work with entities (objects of class Entity) in your Clojure programs.
;;;; You should only work with entity-maps, which are standard Clojure struct-maps.

;;;; CHANGING DATA.
;;;;
;;;; Changing data in entity-maps should not be done directly via (assoc ...) but by using the
;;;; (assoc-and-track-changes ...) function. This keeps a log of changes in the meta-data
;;;; of the returned entity-map and can therefore be used to check if an entity-map needs
;;;; to be updated in the datastore.

;;;; If you want to save soemthing to the datastore, you are using the store!-function
;;;; You just hand-over an entity-map. The system converts this automatically to an entity
;;;; of the correct kind and stores that into the datastore.

(comment
  (store! (make-project :title "Project1")))

;;;; RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENTITIES
;;;;
;;;; At the moment it's only possible to define parent-key relationships between entities.
;;;; Ex.
;;;; (def-parent-key-relationship project phase)
;;;; creates a function called (phases-for-project-id [project-key queries]) which can be used
;;;; to query the datastore for phases that are children of the given parent-key.
;;;; creates a function called (project-id-of-phase [phase]) which returns the id for a phase
